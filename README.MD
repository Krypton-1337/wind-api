## About The Project

this project was made because in the city i live in(doral) there is a Trash-to-energy plant that releases stinky fumes into the air that are most likley toxic and not healthy in inheal. I made the python code using OpenWeather API and twillio API to determine the wind direction of the gas and if its within the angle of my home. It will send a SMS message to my phone using the Twillio API if there is incomming winds. This can be expanded accross all of doral and protect elders from possibly getting harmed from this. This was one of my early python projects a small project. Any feedback would be awesome!
