## About The Project

this project was made because in the city i live in(doral) there is a Trash-to-energy plant that releases stinky fumes into the air that are most likley toxic and not healthy in inheal. I made the python code using OpenWeather API and twillio API to determine the wind direction of the gas and if its within the angle of my home it will send a SMS message to my phone using the Twillio API. This was one of my early python projects a small project. Any feedback would be awesome
